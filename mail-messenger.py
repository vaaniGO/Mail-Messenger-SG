                                Your task is to identify whether or not the email is an event email. 
                                An event is defined as the following - 
                                An event is something that happens or is regarded as happening; an occurrence, especially one of some importance.

                                Some key aspects of what constitutes an event are Change, Specificity, Significance.
                                An event always has a date, time (compulsorily) and a venue (optionally, venue could be 'tbd' or unspecified) associated with it. Moreover, the language
                                in the email corresponds to a that of an event clearly. Note that 'deadlines' are not the same as timings of an events. Look out
                                for differences in date-time mentioned in deadlines v/s for events.
                                Once you have identified it, respond with a tuple. The first item in the tuple is a boolean True or False ONLY. Do not even change the case of the words. It has to be True/False.
                                If your answer is false, the second item is an empty object. 
                                If you answer is true, the second item is a JSON object containing specifications of the event.
                                Specifications of the event include: 
                                1. Name of the event
                                2. Organising Body (If the event is a collaboration between 2 or more bodies, mention all)
                                3. Date, Time, Venue (If this is a word like 'Today' or 'Tomorrow', then use look at the timestamp of the email mentioning
                                this day to calculate the date of the event from the day and replace appropriately. Words should not appear in the JSON object, only proper dates.)
                                4. A concise descriptive summary of the event
                                Only extract names of organising bodies from the 'From' part provided to you. No other part of the email should be consulted for this. 
                                Moreover the descriptive summary should not involve you elaborating on any terms mentioned in the email. Simply summarise the email content. Do not elaborate or use your knowledge to explain the event at all. 
                                Moreover, when figuring out the venue, look out for the entire venue. For example if the event is 'in front of the mess' then the venue is 'in front of the mess', not just 'mess'. 
                                Similarly, if the event is taking place 'in the mess lawns', the venue is 'the mess lawns', not 'lawns'. Be liberal in selecting the venue, it can be a phrase too, not just a location.
                                Example of a valid JSON object is: 
                                {{
                                    "Name of the event": "AI and Ethics Symposium",
                                    "Organising Body": ["Computer Science Department", "Centre for AI Policy"],
                                    "Date, Time, Venue": {{
                                        "Date": "2025-03-15",
                                        "Time": "10:00 AM - 4:00 PM",
                                        "Venue": "AC-02-LR-011"
                                    }},
                                    "Descriptive Summary": "The AI and Ethics Symposium brings together leading experts, scholars, and students to explore the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. The event includes keynote speeches and poster presentations."
                                }}
                                Make sure you appropriately close the braces in the JSON object and follow all specifications of how a JSON object should be.
                                Your answer should be ONLY the tuple. No other surrounding words or phrases. The tuple must NOT be enclosed in brackets. I repeat, the tuple must NOT be enclosed in brackets and there should be no other surrounding characters or words from you. Just write True/False followed by a comma and then the object. No other characters.
